## Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

---

In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

> **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the iPython Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to  \n",
    "**File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut.  Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

The rubric contains _optional_ "Stand Out Suggestions" for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the "Stand Out Suggestions", you should include the code in this IPython notebook.

### Why We're Here

In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!).

![Sample Dog Output](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RmtlCoZaSZuc4QwvaoERf0p4VCo79wbi)

In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

## Step 0: Import Datasets

### Import Dog Dataset

In the code cell below, we import a dataset of dog images.  We populate a few variables through the use of the `load_files` function from the scikit-learn library:
- `train_files`, `valid_files`, `test_files` - numpy arrays containing file paths to images
- `train_targets`, `valid_targets`, `test_targets` - numpy arrays containing onehot-encoded classification labels
- `dog_names` - list of string-valued dog breed names for translating labels


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_files       
from keras.utils import np_utils
import numpy as np
from glob import glob

# define function to load train, test, and validation datasets
def load_dataset(path):
    data = load_files(path)
    dog_files = np.array(data['filenames'])
    dog_targets = np_utils.to_categorical(np.array(data['target']), 133)
    return dog_files, dog_targets

# load train, test, and validation datasets
train_files, train_targets = load_dataset('/data/dog_images/train')
valid_files, valid_targets = load_dataset('/data/dog_images/valid')
test_files, test_targets = load_dataset('/data/dog_images/test')

# load list of dog names
# changing position from 20 -> 27
dog_names = [item[27:-1] for item in sorted(glob("/data/dog_images/train/*/"))]

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total dog categories.' % len(dog_names))
print('There are %s total dog images.\n' % len(np.hstack([train_files, valid_files, test_files])))
print('There are %d training dog images.' % len(train_files))
print('There are %d validation dog images.' % len(valid_files))
print('There are %d test dog images.'% len(test_files))
```

    Using TensorFlow backend.


    There are 133 total dog categories.
    There are 8351 total dog images.

    There are 6680 training dog images.
    There are 835 validation dog images.
    There are 836 test dog images.


### Import Human Dataset

In the code cell below, we import a dataset of human images, where the file paths are stored in the numpy array `human_files`.


```python
import random
random.seed(8675309)

# load filenames in shuffled human dataset
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
random.shuffle(human_files)

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
```

    There are 13233 total human images.

## Step 1: Detect Humans

We use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.

In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.


```python
human_files[3]
```




    '/data/lfw/Khatol_Mohammad_Zai/Khatol_Mohammad_Zai_0001.jpg'




```python
import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
%matplotlib inline                               

# extract pre-trained face detector
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')

# load color (BGR) image
img = cv2.imread(human_files[3])
# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),3)

# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()
```

    Number of faces detected: 1


![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mAgHZ2N1D_ps691cx8Gdd1gzlzdRyj7B)




Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  

In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.

### Write a Human Face Detector

We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.


```python
# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    return len(faces) > 0
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector

__Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
- What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
- What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face?

Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

__Answer:__   
What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?   **100 %**  
What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face?  **11 %**


```python
human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = train_files[:100]
# Do NOT modify the code above this line.

percentage_humans_detected = 100 * (sum([face_detector(file) for file in human_files_short])/float(len(human_files_short)))
percentage_dogs_detected = 100 * (sum([face_detector(file) for file in dog_files_short])/float(len(dog_files_short)))
## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
print(" performance of OpenCV2's Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers model on Human Images is {0} %".format(percentage_humans_detected))
print(" performance of OpenCV2's Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers model on Dog Images is {0} %".format(percentage_dogs_detected))
```

     performance of OpenCV2's Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers model on Human Images is 100.0 %
     performance of OpenCV2's Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers model on Dog Images is 11.0 %


### Observations from random image experiment


```python
import random
def a_random_image(img_array):
    img_to_display = random.choice(range(0, len(img_array)))
    print("image path is \n {0}".format(img_array[img_to_display]))
    img_sample = cv2.imread(img_array[img_to_display])
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img_sample, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))
    for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
        # add bounding box to color image
        cv2.rectangle(img_sample,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),3)
    cv_rgb_sample = cv2.cvtColor(img_sample, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    plt.imshow(cv_rgb_sample)
```


File name - **/data/dog_images/train/106.Newfoundland/Newfoundland_06989.jpg** detects a human in the image.  
Another weird example - **/data/dog_images/train/099.Lhasa_apso/Lhasa_apso_06646.jpg** detects a dog chain as human.  
Play with this fuction :)


```python
print("lets see how the images of dogs are. This function projects a random image")
a_random_image(dog_files_short)
```

    lets see how the images of dogs are. This function projects a random image

__Question 2:__ This algorithmic choice necessitates that we communicate to the user that we accept human images only when they provide a clear view of a face (otherwise, we risk having unneccessarily frustrated users!). In your opinion, is this a reasonable expectation to pose on the user? If not, can you think of a way to detect humans in images that does not necessitate an image with a clearly presented face?

__Answer:__
The answer depends on the utility of the face detection application. If the application is used to login into say a banking site and expects a face detected login process, The user is very well aware that they need to be static and show the face clearly to the cam and their facial features projected in the centre of the cam( User will be very frustrated if there is a false positive login). In this case, its a reasonable expectation. If we are deploying this application to identify faces in real time in a high tension border between two countries and the App's utility is to alarm the military operations about the alien faces in the region,  this app may fail to correctly identify the aliens walking along the border. There we need a more sophisticated deep learning image/object detection algorithm deployed. Here is my response on how good the Haar cascade classifiers can be.

** Limitations and advantages of Haar Cascade classifiers **

   I am summarizing my understanding from the [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-the-difference-between-haar-feature-classifiers-and-convolutional-neural-networks-ce6828343aeb)  
   1. Haar cascade classifiers has limited pre defined kernels while Deep networks like CNNs can train new kernels. We can use Haar cascade classifiers even with small datasets. All we need to know is to identify which kernel to prioritize for the dataset. Haar cascade classfiers are very good in identifying edges and line features. Haar cascade classifiers fail when the face is manipulated. My second example above (live face detection in motion) is the usecase where we should not use Haar cascades.
   2. Haar cascades are much faster than deep nets like MTCNN.I would suggest MTCNN to use if we care a lot about accuracy in image detection, If the there are no full frontal images, if the there is a quality lag in the picture, if we want to identify variety of face images with all possible projections.



We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :).  Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on each of the datasets.


```python
## (Optional) TODO: Report the performance of another  
## face detection algorithm on the LFW dataset

## Step 2: Detect Dogs

In this section, we use a pre-trained [ResNet-50](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006) model to detect dogs in images.  Our first line of code downloads the ResNet-50 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  Given an image, this pre-trained ResNet-50 model returns a prediction (derived from the available categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.


```python
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50

# define ResNet50 model
ResNet50_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
```

    102858752/102853048 [==============================] - 1s 0us/step


### Pre-process the Data

When using TensorFlow as backend, Keras CNNs require a 4D array (which we'll also refer to as a 4D tensor) as input, with shape

$$
(\text{nb_samples}, \text{rows}, \text{columns}, \text{channels}),
$$

where `nb_samples` corresponds to the total number of images (or samples), and `rows`, `columns`, and `channels` correspond to the number of rows, columns, and channels for each image, respectively.  

The `path_to_tensor` function below takes a string-valued file path to a color image as input and returns a 4D tensor suitable for supplying to a Keras CNN.  The function first loads the image and resizes it to a square image that is $224 \times 224$ pixels.  Next, the image is converted to an array, which is then resized to a 4D tensor.  In this case, since we are working with color images, each image has three channels.  Likewise, since we are processing a single image (or sample), the returned tensor will always have shape

$$
(1, 224, 224, 3).
$$

The `paths_to_tensor` function takes a numpy array of string-valued image paths as input and returns a 4D tensor with shape

$$
(\text{nb_samples}, 224, 224, 3).
$$

Here, `nb_samples` is the number of samples, or number of images, in the supplied array of image paths.  It is best to think of `nb_samples` as the number of 3D tensors (where each 3D tensor corresponds to a different image) in your dataset!


```python
from keras.preprocessing import image                  
from tqdm import tqdm

def path_to_tensor(img_path):
    # loads RGB image as PIL.Image.Image type
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    # convert PIL.Image.Image type to 3D tensor with shape (224, 224, 3)
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    # convert 3D tensor to 4D tensor with shape (1, 224, 224, 3) and return 4D tensor
    return np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

def paths_to_tensor(img_paths):
    list_of_tensors = [path_to_tensor(img_path) for img_path in tqdm(img_paths)]
    return np.vstack(list_of_tensors)
```

### Making Predictions with ResNet-50

Getting the 4D tensor ready for ResNet-50, and for any other pre-trained model in Keras, requires some additional processing.  First, the RGB image is converted to BGR by reordering the channels.  All pre-trained models have the additional normalization step that the mean pixel (expressed in RGB as $[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]$ and calculated from all pixels in all images in ImageNet) must be subtracted from every pixel in each image.  This is implemented in the imported function `preprocess_input`.  If you're curious, you can check the code for `preprocess_input` [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py).

Now that we have a way to format our image for supplying to ResNet-50, we are now ready to use the model to extract the predictions.  This is accomplished with the `predict` method, which returns an array whose $i$-th entry is the model's predicted probability that the image belongs to the $i$-th ImageNet category.  This is implemented in the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function below.

By taking the argmax of the predicted probability vector, we obtain an integer corresponding to the model's predicted object class, which we can identify with an object category through the use of this [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).


```python
from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

def ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path):
    # returns prediction vector for image located at img_path
    img = preprocess_input(path_to_tensor(img_path))
    return np.argmax(ResNet50_model.predict(img))
```

### Write a Dog Detector

While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, we need only check if the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function above returns a value between 151 and 268 (inclusive).

We use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).


```python
### returns "True" if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path
def dog_detector(img_path):
    prediction = ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path)
    return ((prediction <= 268) & (prediction >= 151))
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Dog Detector

__Question 3:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of your `dog_detector` function.  
- What percentage of the images in `human_files_short` have a detected dog?  
- What percentage of the images in `dog_files_short` have a detected dog?

__Answer:__  
  What percentage of the images in `human_files_short` have a detected dog? **0 %**  
  What percentage of the images in `dog_files_short` have a detected dog? **100 %**    


```python
### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function
### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
percentage_humans_detected_resnet = 100 * (sum([dog_detector(file) for file in human_files_short])/float(len(human_files_short)))
percentage_dogs_detected_resnet = 100 * (sum([dog_detector(file) for file in dog_files_short])/float(len(dog_files_short)))
## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
print(" Percentage of dog images predicted by Resnet50 on Human Images is {0} %".format(percentage_humans_detected_resnet))
print(" Percentage of dog images predicted by Resnet50 on Dog Images is {0} %".format(percentage_dogs_detected_resnet))
```

     Percentage of dog images predicted by Resnet50 on Human Images is 0.0 %
     Percentage of dog images predicted by Resnet50 on Dog Images is 100.0 %

<a id='step3'></a>
## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 1%.  In Step 5 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.

Be careful with adding too many trainable layers!  More parameters means longer training, which means you are more likely to need a GPU to accelerate the training process.  Thankfully, Keras provides a handy estimate of the time that each epoch is likely to take; you can extrapolate this estimate to figure out how long it will take for your algorithm to train.

We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have great difficulty in distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  

Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
- | -
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1piiXDtTytUaKR5rWD0MCkJ81fiXS22MW" width="100"> | <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uJPbMnwlm4JbCByq6O3mMujXrNnRvIPC" width="200">

It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  

Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1M0JSkG390JuEldrv2WLB4tSqBhbAVvzr" width="200"> | <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mOuMaBuCzThqB_gG9PxpBhgrgcYRhC86" width="200">


Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  

Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
- | -
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zFgaiVON4P2SqbP07t9NNkA26gsVVEDl" width="150"> | <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fBYwXejF2CYL8sa7VC5XHnIkijeoBx_c" width="240"> | <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Svh6war1GibLfUxCeCKihiXUmA4Z_-Cu" width="220">

We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  

Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!

### Pre-process the Data

We rescale the images by dividing every pixel in every image by 255.


```python
from PIL import ImageFile                            
ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True                 

# pre-process the data for Keras
train_tensors = paths_to_tensor(train_files).astype('float32')/255
valid_tensors = paths_to_tensor(valid_files).astype('float32')/255
test_tensors = paths_to_tensor(test_files).astype('float32')/255
```

    100%|██████████| 6680/6680 [01:28<00:00, 48.50it/s]
    100%|██████████| 835/835 [00:10<00:00, 83.26it/s]
    100%|██████████| 836/836 [00:09<00:00, 83.89it/s]


### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture

Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  At the end of your code cell block, summarize the layers of your model by executing the line:

        model.summary()

We have imported some Python modules to get you started, but feel free to import as many modules as you need.  If you end up getting stuck, here's a hint that specifies a model that trains relatively fast on CPU and attains >1% test accuracy in 5 epochs:

The CNN architecture has 3 Pair (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D) followed by two Dropout and two Dense layer pairs. The activation functions used until the final Dense layer is `relu`. At the final layer I have used `softmax`.

The Conv2D layers discovers the hierarchies of spatial patterns in the image. Each Conv2D layer increases the depth of the Image. It is increased using the filter parameter. Here at each layer I have 2 X ed the depth of the convolutional layer from the previous layer. Hyper parameter - padding is used to ensure that the conv layer's Spatial features are maintained as the previous layer. kernel size defines side length of the filter. Stride ( not mentioned here - defaults to 1) defines how the Conv2D filter is moved along the image.

MaxPooling2D layers are used to shrinken the height and width of the image to 1/2 its size from the previous layer.The hyper parameter used here - poolsize ( and stride, which defaults to poolsize if not mentioned) are responsible for this shrinkage. As we can see  the height and width reduced from 224 to 28.

The sequence of pairs of (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D) layers gradually loses the spatial data and encodes the content of the image. At the end of the 3rd Maxpooling Layer output, the 3D array will have content which can answer questions like

* Is this a hairless or its furry
* Does the animal have long or short tail etc,.

Once I have deduced and lost as much of the spatial info, I Dropout and flatten the 3D array and pass it on to a Dense layer. Dense layer is a fully connected layer. To reduce the number of parameters to pass on to final Dense layer, a Droput layer is added. The Dropout layer randomly omits the percentage of data to train ( I have given 40 % ) before passing it along to a dense layer.

Final layer has softmax as its activation function. It outputs a (133,1) array where each entry is a probability that the image belongs to the following category.

The gradient descent optimization method I have used is `adam` and the loss function I am trying to optimize is `categorical crossentropy` for 133 categories. The metrics I care about is `accuracy`


In 5 iterations of thius model (epochs), I was able to bring in accuracy of `6.58%`



```python

### Compile the Model


```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Train the Model

Train your model in the code cell below.  Use model checkpointing to save the model that attains the best validation loss.

You are welcome to [augment the training data](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html), but this is not a requirement.


```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint
```


```python


### TODO: specify the number of epochs that you would like to use to train the model.

epochs = 5

### Do NOT modify the code below this line.

checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath='saved_models/weights.best.from_scratch.hdf5',
                               verbose=1, save_best_only=True)

model.fit(train_tensors, train_targets,
          validation_data=(valid_tensors, valid_targets),

### Load the Model with the Best Validation Loss


```python
model.load_weights('saved_models/weights.best.from_scratch.hdf5')
```

### Test the Model

Try out your model on the test dataset of dog images.  Ensure that your test accuracy is greater than 1%.


```python
# get index of predicted dog breed for each image in test set
dog_breed_predictions = [np.argmax(model.predict(np.expand_dims(tensor, axis=0))) for tensor in test_tensors]

# report test accuracy
test_accuracy = 100*np.sum(np.array(dog_breed_predictions)==np.argmax(test_targets, axis=1))/len(dog_breed_predictions)
print('Test accuracy: %.4f%%' % test_accuracy)
```

    Test accuracy: 6.5789%


---
<a id='step4'></a>
## Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds

To reduce training time without sacrificing accuracy, we show you how to train a CNN using transfer learning.  In the following step, you will get a chance to use transfer learning to train your own CNN.

### Obtain Bottleneck Features


```python
bottleneck_features = np.load('/data/bottleneck_features/DogVGG16Data.npz')
train_VGG16 = bottleneck_features['train']
valid_VGG16 = bottleneck_features['valid']
test_VGG16 = bottleneck_features['test']
```


```python
train_VGG16.shape[1:]
```




    (7, 7, 512)



### Model Architecture

The model uses the the pre-trained VGG-16 model as a fixed feature extractor, where the last convolutional output of VGG-16 is fed as input to our model.  We only add a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer, where the latter contains one node for each dog category and is equipped with a softmax.


```python
VGG16_model = Sequential()
VGG16_model.add(GlobalAveragePooling2D(input_shape=train_VGG16.shape[1:]))
VGG16_model.add(Dense(133, activation='softmax'))

VGG16_model.summary()
```

### Load the Model with the Best Validation Loss


```python
VGG16_model.load_weights('saved_models/weights.best.VGG16.hdf5')
```

### Test the Model

Now, we can use the CNN to test how well it identifies breed within our test dataset of dog images.  We print the test accuracy below.


```python
# get index of predicted dog breed for each image in test set
VGG16_predictions = [np.argmax(VGG16_model.predict(np.expand_dims(feature, axis=0))) for feature in test_VGG16]

# report test accuracy
test_accuracy = 100*np.sum(np.array(VGG16_predictions)==np.argmax(test_targets, axis=1))/len(VGG16_predictions)
print('Test accuracy: %.4f%%' % test_accuracy)
```

    Test accuracy: 44.3780%


### Predict Dog Breed with the Model


```python
from extract_bottleneck_features import *

def VGG16_predict_breed(img_path):
    # extract bottleneck features
    bottleneck_feature = extract_VGG16(path_to_tensor(img_path))
    # obtain predicted vector
    predicted_vector = VGG16_model.predict(bottleneck_feature)
    # return dog breed that is predicted by the model
    return dog_names[np.argmax(predicted_vector)]
```

---
<a id='step5'></a>
## Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.  Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.

In Step 4, we used transfer learning to create a CNN using VGG-16 bottleneck features.  In this section, you must use the bottleneck features from a different pre-trained model.  To make things easier for you, we have pre-computed the features for all of the networks that are currently available in Keras.  These are already in the workspace, at /data/bottleneck_features.  If you wish to download them on a different machine, they can be found at:

where `{network}`, in the above filename, can be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.  

The above architectures are downloaded and stored for you in the `/data/bottleneck_features/` folder.

This means the following will be in the `/data/bottleneck_features/` folder:

`DogVGG19Data.npz`
`DogResnet50Data.npz`
`DogInceptionV3Data.npz`
`DogXceptionData.npz`



### (IMPLEMENTATION) Obtain Bottleneck Features

In the code block below, extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the train, test, and validation sets by running the following:

    bottleneck_features = np.load('/data/bottleneck_features/Dog{network}Data.npz')
    train_{network} = bottleneck_features['train']
    valid_{network} = bottleneck_features['valid']
    test_{network} = bottleneck_features['test']


```python
### TODO: Obtain bottleneck features from another pre-trained CNN.
bottleneck_features = np.load('/data/bottleneck_features/DogXceptionData.npz')
train_Xception = bottleneck_features['train']
valid_Xception = bottleneck_features['valid']
test_Xception = bottleneck_features['test']
```


```python
train_Xception.shape
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture

Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  At the end of your code cell block, summarize the layers of your model by executing the line:

        <your model's name>.summary()

__Question 5:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

__Answer:__


I have chosen Xception Model. The reasoning behind it was, it used a modified version of depthwise seperable convolutional layers. I followed these two articles to understand its significance while training a deep network.

* https://towardsdatascience.com/a-basic-introduction-to-separable-convolutions-b99ec3102728
* https://towardsdatascience.com/review-xception-with-depthwise-separable-convolution-better-than-inception-v3-image-dc967dd42568

 The dataset I have in hand is a small dataset (8351 images in total). Xception model has weights from Imagenet database which does have more than 120 dog breeds. So we are dealing with a similar model + small dataset. All I have done here is cut down the top layer (final layer) of the xception model and trained it to identify 133 dog categories instead of 10000 categories from imagenet.

Here is reasoning behind the current CNN model.

1. I have downloaded the pre-computed bottleneck features of Xception model. That is each dog image is sent to  (Xception model, imagenet weights) with its top layer cut off. The resulting output for every image is `(7,7,2048)`

2. This output is introduced as input to my custom `Xception_model` which has a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer and a pair of Dropout and Dense Layer.

3. GlobalAveragePooling2D is used to totally remove the spatial data and encode the contents of the image. It also reduces the number of features that `Xception_model` has to learn.

4. The Dropout layer is used to randomly omit 40% of the hidden units out of 272517  with which it has to finally classify 133 categories.

5. The dense layer is a fully connected layer which outputs the probability of image being in 133 categories. The highest probability category is considered to be the predicted label. The activation function  used in this layer is softmax.

The model is compiled optimize `categorical cross entropy` loss function and used `adam` as the gradient descent function. The model has `accuracy` as its metric.

It was blazing fast and I could achieve `85.64%` as accuracy in the hold out test set with the trained model -(epoch 20)






```python
### TODO: Define your architecture.
Xception_model = Sequential()
Xception_model.add(GlobalAveragePooling2D(input_shape=train_Xception.shape[1:]))
Xception_model.add(Dropout(0.4))
Xception_model.add(Dense(133, activation='softmax'))
Xception_model.summary()
```

```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Train the Model

Train your model in the code cell below.  Use model checkpointing to save the model that attains the best validation loss.  

You are welcome to [augment the training data](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html), but this is not a requirement.


```python

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Load the Model with the Best Validation Loss


```python
### TODO: Load the model weights with the best validation loss.
Xception_model.load_weights('saved_models/weights.best.Xception.hdf5')
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Test the Model

Try out your model on the test dataset of dog images. Ensure that your test accuracy is greater than 60%.


```python
### TODO: Calculate classification accuracy on the test dataset.
Xception_predictions = [np.argmax(Xception_model.predict(np.expand_dims(feature, axis=0))) for feature in test_Xception]

# report test accuracy
test_accuracy = 100*np.sum(np.array(Xception_predictions)==np.argmax(test_targets, axis=1))/len(Xception_predictions)
print('Test accuracy: %.4f%%' % test_accuracy)
```

    Test accuracy: 85.6459%


### (IMPLEMENTATION) Predict Dog Breed with the Model

Write a function that takes an image path as input and returns the dog breed (`Affenpinscher`, `Afghan_hound`, etc) that is predicted by your model.  

Similar to the analogous function in Step 5, your function should have three steps:
1. Extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the chosen CNN model.
2. Supply the bottleneck features as input to the model to return the predicted vector.  Note that the argmax of this prediction vector gives the index of the predicted dog breed.
3. Use the `dog_names` array defined in Step 0 of this notebook to return the corresponding breed.

The functions to extract the bottleneck features can be found in `extract_bottleneck_features.py`, and they have been imported in an earlier code cell.  To obtain the bottleneck features corresponding to your chosen CNN architecture, you need to use the function

    extract_{network}

where `{network}`, in the above filename, should be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.


```python
### TODO: Write a function that takes a path to an image as input
### and returns the dog breed that is predicted by the model.

def Xception_predict_breed(img_path):
    # extract bottleneck features
    bottleneck_feature = extract_Xception(path_to_tensor(img_path))
    # obtain predicted vector
    predicted_vector = Xception_model.predict(bottleneck_feature)
    # return dog breed that is predicted by the model
    return dog_names[np.argmax(predicted_vector)]
```

<a id='step6'></a>
## Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Write an algorithm that accepts a file path to an image and first determines whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither.  Then,
- if a __dog__ is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.
- if a __human__ is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.
- if __neither__ is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.

You are welcome to write your own functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, but feel free to use the `face_detector` and `dog_detector` functions developed above.  You are __required__ to use your CNN from Step 5 to predict dog breed.  

Some sample output for our algorithm is provided below, but feel free to design your own user experience!

    cv_rgb_output = cv2.cvtColor(img_output, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

        plt.imshow(cv_rgb_output)
        plt.show()
        print("You are very close to dog breed {0}".format(predicted_breed))
    else:

        plt.show()
        print("ERROR!!!! ALIENS SPOTTED")

## Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

In this section, you will take your new algorithm for a spin!  What kind of dog does the algorithm think that __you__ look like?  If you have a dog, does it predict your dog's breed accurately?  If you have a cat, does it mistakenly think that your cat is a dog?

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Test Your Algorithm on Sample Images!

Test your algorithm at least six images on your computer.  Feel free to use any images you like.  Use at least two human and two dog images.  

__Question 6:__ Is the output better than you expected :) ?  Or worse :( ?  Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.

__Answer:__

I have shared my observation with my experimentation below.

I expected this to work fine. The Restnet50 model is trained initally to check if the image falls under categories 151-268 of [Imagenet database](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a) . these two images didnt pass that test for sure. So it checked with Haarcascade human face detector. It failed there as well. So our algorithm turned cats to aliens :D

I am unsure why the model predicted me and Donald trump to the same breed. We don't have similar color features (be it hair or skin color). I am smiling and I have a long due unshaven beard while DJT is clean shaven. His is a side projected image while I am facing the camera. I have furthered my research later in the section

#### Testing how our Algo works with the images we already have.

This is a game. If you pass the image array and image target `dog_app_checker` will predict if the dog is actually classified to correct breed or not. if it is classified to correct breed, you will have an affirmation in Green color else you will have a warning in red color.  


```python
class bcolors:
    GREEN = '\033[92m'
    RED = '\033[91m'
    ENDC = '\033[0m'
```


```python
def dog_app_checker(img_array, img_target):
    # randomly select a dog from test image
    img_to_display = random.choice(range(0,len(img_array)))
    predicted_breed = dog_app(img_array[img_to_display])
    actual_label = dog_names[np.argmax(img_target[img_to_display])]
    if predicted_breed==actual_label:
        output =  "SUCCESS! Actual label is {0}".format(actual_label)
        print(bcolors.GREEN +output+bcolors.ENDC)
    else:
        output =  "FAILURE! Actual label is Testing{0} and predicted breed is {1}".format(actual_label, predicted_breed)
        print(bcolors.RED +output+bcolors.ENDC)
    # predict the label and compare with the original test target
```


```python
dog_app_checker(test_files,test_targets)
```

    hello, dog!
     you belong to dog breed Bullmastiff

        ax = fig.add_subplot(rows, 2, counter, xticks=[], yticks=[])
        ax.set_title("original")
        ax.imshow(read_img_helper(file_list[idx]))

        counter +=1
        ax1 = fig.add_subplot(rows, 2, counter, xticks=[], yticks=[])
        ax1.set_title("predicted as {0}".format(predicted_breed_list[idx]))

None of the above predictions were right. but I could empathise with the model. Also I understand that the animations are exagerrations of reality. But some striking observations here.

1. English settler animae had dots which is a vital observation even to the human eyes. If I were to predict the breed I would have also told that it is a Dalmation.
2. Boston terrier, Cardigan welsh corgi and toy fox terrier all are dwarf dogs. All of them have a similarity in their appearance. That is, the colors from forehead to eyelids are different from colors from eyelids to the legs. May be this pattern is more prevalent in Cardigan welsh corgi. We could lalso see top 5 suggestions from the model in this case. I am sure, Boston terrier, Toy fox terrier would have been there in the top 5 list in their respective prediction vectors.
3. Chinese Sherpei and Bull mastiff has kinda siilar facial features.

I am not sure how to reason the above predicitons.

My next steps to improve dog app:

1. Multi Object identification can be introduced to this dog app. Identifying more than one dog breed present in the image. That makes the data collection process easier. We don't have to do any more cleansing part.

2. I have not done image augumented training. That is training that learns scale, rotation and transalation invariant images. I believe that passing ton the augumented image to the Xception network to produce intermediate (7 X 7 X 2048) features for each image would enrich the classification accuracy.

3. I would like to dabble with hyper parameters like gradient descent algorithm of choice. I have triend out Adam and RMSProp. But I would like to see how model reacts for algorithms like AdaMax, AdaGrad, nestrov Accerlated Momentum, etc.


```python
multi_dogs = glob("test_images/dangerous/*")
plot_original_and_predicted(multi_dogs)
```

These are supoosedly the most [dangerous dog breeds](https://www.marshallspetzone.com/blog/top-4-dangerous-dog-breeds/) Again the model failed me with the prediction. Time to retrain :D
